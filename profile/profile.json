I hold a master’s degree in AI and Natural Language Processing from the University of Montreal and a double bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and French Studies from Penn State University. Professionally, I’ve worked as a C# and SQL backend developer at a leading FinTech company and completed three internships in backend development and data science. In my free time, I develop chatbots, LLM applications, and am currently working on a mobile development project. I’m proficient in Java and SQL, with a solid grasp of the Software Development Life Cycle, Data Structures, Cloud technologies, and Core Algorithms. A quick learner with a growth mindset, I’m eager to tackle challenges in the ever-evolving tech industry. I’ve also developed a keen interest in FinTech and aspire to explore trading and quantitative finance. On a lighter note, I’m a classical pianist who dabbles in jazz and have maintained a 1500-day streak on Duolingo."

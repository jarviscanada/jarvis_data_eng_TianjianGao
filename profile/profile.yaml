# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Highly motivated and analytical Computer Science graduate and finance enthusiast with hands-on experience in Java, Python, and SQL full-stack development. I hold a masters's degree in Machine Learning from the University of Montreal and dual bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science and French Studies from Penn State University. Professionally, I have worked as a C# and SQL backend developer at a leading FinTech company and completed three internships in application development and data science. In my free time, I develop chatbots, LLM applications, and am currently working on an mobile application. I’m proficient in Java and SQL and their ecosystems, with a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, multi-threading, and system programming. With a competitive programming mindset, I am eager to tackle challenges in high-performance financial applications. On a lighter note, I’m a musician who dabbles in classical, jazz and rock piano, a dedicated yogi, and have maintained a 1500-day streak on Duolingo (perseverance is key to success).

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Monitoring"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Automated a Linux cluster monitoring agent on GCP using Bash scripts, Docker, and PostgreSQL - Linux administrators often require monitoring the resource usage (e.g. CPU, memory, and disk) of each cluster node in real time, for logging and resource planning purposes. The project leverages Docker to provision a Postgres database to support automated logging and admin querying using SQL. System information is captured using Linux commands. Crontab is used to schedule updates to the host usage table at every minute via SQL. The scripts are tested on a remote GCP virtual server running on Rocky Linux.
  - name: "SQL Tennis Court Management"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: Created a PostgreSQL database for managing sessions, members, and facilities of a tennis court. Implemented SQL queries for efficient CRUD operations and data aggregation. The dataset includes tables for members, facilities, and bookings, each with unique structures that reflect common issues found in real-world databases. The project includes exercises on key PostgreSQL topics — DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), joins, aggregations, string operations, and window functions.
  - name: "Java Grep App"
    git_url: "/core_java/grep"
    description: Grep is a popular Linux command-line utility for searching patterns in plaintext using regular expressions. However, it might not be easily accessible on certain operating systems such as Windows. As such, I have developed an Java application to emulate Linux Grep, using Java's Pattern library. To optimize memory usage, the Java Stream API is also used in conjunction with Lambda expressions to allow streaming for processing instead of having to load all data into the memory, achieving 25% reduction in memory usage. The application is unit tested extensively using JUnit and project dependencies are managed using Maven. The application is dockerized and can be accessed using a Windows terminal.
  - name: "Java Stock Quote App"
    git_url: "/core_java/jdbc"
    description: Developed a robust Java application to retrieve stock quotes from the Alpha Vantage API, employing the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern for efficient interaction with a PostgreSQL database via JDBC. Architected service and controller layers to manage business logic and facilitate user interactions. Leveraged JUnit and Mockito frameworks for comprehensive unit and integration testing, validating API interactions and ensuring reliable data access and storage. This project highlights effective use of design patterns and test-driven development practices to deliver a high-quality, maintainable codebase.
  - name: "Spring Boot Trading App"
    git_url: "/springboot"
    description: Designed and implemented a RESTful trading application using **Spring Boot**, focusing on clean API design and efficient data handling. Developed multiple controllers (Quote, Trader, Order, Dashboard) with **Spring MVC** annotations to manage entities like **Trader**, **Account**, and **SecurityOrder**. Integrated **JPA** and **Hibernate** for database interactions, leveraging **Spring Data JPA** for seamless CRUD operations. Implemented exception handling, input validation, and security best practices, and deployed on a web server to handle stock trading operations.
  - name: "PySpark Data Analytics (Data Engineering)"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: Currently developing a scalable data analytics solution using PySpark to process large datasets for the London Gift Shop (LGS). Re-architecting the existing Python and Jupyter Notebook solution to run on Zeppelin (Hadoop) and Databricks (Azure) to handle big data in a distributed environment. The project focuses on performing advanced customer analytics to help LGS improve marketing campaigns and customer retention. Deliverables include notebooks for both Zeppelin and Databricks environments, enabling robust data processing and analysis across the company's entire dataset.

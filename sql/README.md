# Introduction

This PostgreSQL project is centred around a fictional country club, providing a rich dataset with members, facilities, and booking histories to explore. The primary goal is to analyze facility usage and demand through practical exercises that simulate real-world database challenges. The dataset includes tables for members, facilities, and bookings, each with unique structures that reflect common issues found in real-world databases. The project includes exercises on key PostgreSQL topics â€” DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), Joins, Aggregations, and String operations.

## Schema Overview

The **Members** table stores information such as ID, address, membership timestamp, and referrer details. The **Facilities** table lists bookable amenities, capturing details like booking costs, construction expenses, and maintenance estimates, helping the club assess the financial viability of each facility. The **Bookings** table, which logs facility usage by members, stores the facility id, the member who made the booking, the start of the booking, and how many half hour 'slots' the booking was made for. It is used as a junction table or join table and is typically used in many-to-many relationships.

![Membership DB Schema](assets/schema-horizontal.svg)

```sql
CREATE TABLE cd.members (
  memid INTEGER NOT NULL, 
  surname VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL, 
  firstname VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL, 
  address VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL, 
  zipcode INTEGER NOT NULL, 
  telephone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 
  recommendedby INTEGER, 
  joindate TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, 
  CONSTRAINT members_pk PRIMARY KEY (memid), 
  CONSTRAINT fk_members_recommendedby FOREIGN KEY (recommendedby) 
  REFERENCES cd.members(memid) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

`cd.members` has a primary key constraint on memid, ensuring each member has a unique identifier. Additionally, the recommendedby field has a foreign key constraint that references the memid of `cd.bookings`. **ON DELETE SET NULL** ensures that if the referenced member is deleted, the recommendedby field will be set to NULL rather than causing an error or cascading the delete.

```sql
CREATE TABLE cd.bookings
(
    bookid INTEGER NOT NULL,
    facid INTEGER NOT NULL,
    memid INTEGER NOT NULL,
    starttime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    slot INTEGER NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT bookings_pk PRIMARY KEY (bookid),
    CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_facid FOREIGN KEY (facid)
    REFERENCES cd.facilities(facid),
    CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_memid FOREIGN KEY (memid)
    REFERENCES cd.members(memid)
);
```

Note that `cd.bookings` has a primary key constraint on bookid, ensuring each booking has a unique identifier. There are also two foreign key constraints: facid references `cd.facilities(facid)`, linking each booking to a specific facility, and memid references `cd.members(memid)`, linking each booking to a specific member.

```sql
CREATE TABLE cd.facilities
(
    facid INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    membercost NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    guestcost NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    initialoutlay NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    monthlymaintenance NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT facilities_pk PRIMARY KEY (facid)
);
```

Lastly, `cd.facilities` has a primary key constraint on facid, ensuring each facility has a unique identifier. It also helps `cd.bookings` find information about the facilities.

## CRUD Operations

![Membership DB Schema](assets/schema-horizontal.svg)

### ["Insert some data into a table"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/updates/insert.html)

The club is adding a new facility - a spa. We need to add it into the facilities table. Use the following values:
*facid: 9, Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.*

```sql
INSERT INTO cd.facilities
    (
    facid, name, membercost, guestcost,
    initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance
    )
VALUES
    (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);
```

### ["Insert calculated data into a table"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/updates/insert3.html)

Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, rather than specifying it as a constant. Use the following values for everything else: *Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.*

```sql
INSERT INTO cd.facilities
    (
    facid, name, membercost, guestcost,
    initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance
    )
VALUES
    (
        (
        SELECT
            max(facid)
        FROM
            cd.facilities
        ) + 1,
        'Spa',
        20,
        30,
        100000,
        800
  );
```

### ["Update some existing data"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/updates/update.html)

We made a mistake when entering the data for the second tennis court. The initial outlay was 10000 rather than 8000: you need to alter the data to fix the error.

```sql
UPDATE
    cd.facilities
SET
    initialoutlay = 10000
WHERE
    facid = 1;
```

### ["Update a row based on the contents of another row"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/updates/updatecalculated.html)

We want to alter the price of the second tennis court so that it costs 10% more than the first one. Try to do this without using constant values for the prices, so that we can reuse the statement if we want to.

```sql
UPDATE
    cd.facilities facs
SET
    membercost = tc1.membercost * 1.1,
    guestcost = tc1.guestcost * 1.1
FROM
(
    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        cd.facilities
    WHERE
        facid = 0
) tc1
WHERE
    facs.facid = 1;
```

### ["Delete all bookings"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/updates/delete.html)

As part of a clearout of our database, we want to delete all bookings FROM the cd.bookings table. How can we accomplish this?

```sql
DELETE FROM cd.bookings
```

### ["Delete a member FROM the cd.members table"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/updates/deletewh.html)

We want to remove member 37, who has never made a booking, FROM our database. How can we achieve that?

```sql
DELETE FROM
    cd.members
WHERE
    memid = 37;
```

## Select Statements

![Membership DB Schema](assets/schema-horizontal.svg)

### ["Control which rows are retrieved - part 2"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/basic/where2.html)

How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members, and that fee is less than 1/50th of the monthly maintenance cost? Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question.

```sql
SELECT
    facid,
    name,
    membercost,
    monthlymaintenance
FROM
    cd.facilities
WHERE
    membercost > 0
    AND membercost < monthlymaintenance / 50;
```

### ["Basic string searches"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/basic/where3.html)

How can you produce a list of all facilities with the word 'Tennis' in their name?

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    cd.facilities
WHERE
    name LIKE '%Tennis%';
```

### ["Matching against multiple possible values"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/basic/where4.html)

How can you retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5? Try to do it without using the OR operator.

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    cd.facilities
WHERE
    facid in (1, 5);
```

### ["Working with dates"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/basic/date.html)

How can you produce a list of members who joined after the start of September 2012? Return the memid, surname, firstname, and joindate of the members in question.

```sql
SELECT
    memid,
    surname,
    firstname,
    joindate
FROM
    cd.members
WHERE
    joindate > '2012-09-01';
```

### ["Combining results FROM multiple queries"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/basic/union.html)

You, for some reason, want a combined list of all surnames and all facility names. Yes, this is a contrived example :-). Produce that list!

```sql
SELECT

UNION
SELECT
    name
FROM

ORDER BY
    surname,
    firstname;
```

### ["Produce a list of all members, along with their recommender, using no joins"](https://pgexercises.com/questions/joins/sub.html)

SELECT
    DISTINCT concat(m.firstname, ' ', m.surname) as member,
    (
    SELECT
        concat(r.firstname, ' ', r.surname) as recommender

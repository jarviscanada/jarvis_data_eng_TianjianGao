# Tianjian (Lucas) Gao . Jarvis Consulting

I am a highly-motivated young professional with a passion for software development and finance. I hold a master’s degree in AI and Natural Language Processing from the University of Montreal and a double bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and French Studies from Penn State University. Professionally, I’ve worked as a C# and SQL backend developer at a leading FinTech company and completed three internships in backend development and data science. In my free time, I develop chatbots, LLM applications, and am currently working on a mobile development project. I’m proficient in Java and SQL, with a solid grasp of the Software Development Life Cycle, Data Structures, Cloud technologies, and Core Algorithms. A quick learner with a growth mindset, I’m eager to tackle challenges in the ever-evolving tech industry. I’ve also developed a keen interest in FinTech and aspire to explore trading and quantitative finance. On a lighter note, I’m a classical pianist who dabbles in jazz and have maintained a 1500-day streak on Duolingo.

## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2024-present)**: Startup  pour les personnes aux prises avec des troubles de la parole (SLA). Expérimentation avec Gemma-2b sur l’appareil (on-device) pour une saisie automatique, ainsi langchain-dart et OpenAI API pour traiter l’historique des conversations des utilisateurs.

**Lead NLP Developer, Vocality (2024-present)**: Donec mattis sed justo et sagittis. Vestibulum lacinia nulla ipsum. Curabitur imperdiet nibh vitae leo lacinia laoreet. Nullam accumsan, lectus ut maximus ultricies, augue justo egestas mi, vel bibendum felis.

**Backend Developer, Wealth Management Platform, FNZ Group (2023-2024)**: Created SQL tables and views in MS SQL Server and optimized C# backend for a $1.5T AUM wealth management platform.Created and processed REST APIs using parameter binding in .NET and tested server response using Insomnia/Postman.

**Backend Developer Intern, Senior-Care Chatbot, Innovention (2023-2023)**: Developed a natural language understanding (NLU) module using StringBuilder, LINQ, and Stanford NLP to extract entities, and actions in a user query, and built a knowledge graph using Neo4j, improving “common sense” question answering by 100%. Experimented with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Chroma and LangChain for indexing  user info and knowledge.

**Data Scientist Intern, Data-driven Analytics, International Air and Transportation Association (2021-2022)**: Leveraged keyword modeling (AutoPhrase), topic modeling (LDA), unsupervised clustering, and taxonomy generation to extract over 100 new aviation incident topics from 2 million aviation incident reports, helping improve aviation safety.Implemented algorithms from research, ported code from Python 2 to Python 3 and edited shell scripts for model training. Worked within a cross-functional team to share classification models, word embeddings, and taxonomies with member airlines, reducing time and cost for data analytics.

**Data Scientist Intern, Data-driven Analytics, International Air and Transportation Association (2020-2021)**: Preprocessed 2 million multi-lingual aviation reports using spaCy and Gensim. Detected text languages using TextBlob. Trained machine learning models using Scikit-learn, as well as BERT LLMs to classify reports into a multi-level taxonomy using PyTorch. Trained T5 Seq2Seq models and integrated them with the IATA dashboard, thereby facilitating manual classification. Analyzed the reports using Pandas, spaCy, Matplotlib, and TensorBoard. Communicated methodologies and complex data findings effectively with stakeholders.

# Tianjian (Lucas) Gao . Jarvis Consulting

I am a highly-motivated young professional with a passion for software development and finance. I hold a master‚Äôs degree in AI and Natural Language Processing from the University of Montreal and a double bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and French Studies from Penn State University. Professionally, I‚Äôve worked as a C# and SQL backend developer at a leading FinTech company and completed three internships in backend development and data science. In my free time, I develop chatbots, LLM applications, and am currently working on a mobile development project. I‚Äôm proficient in Java and SQL, with a solid grasp of the Software Development Life Cycle, Data Structures, Cloud technologies, and Core Algorithms. A quick learner with a growth mindset, I‚Äôm eager to tackle challenges in the ever-evolving tech industry. I‚Äôve also developed a keen interest in FinTech and aspire to explore trading and quantitative finance. On a lighter note, I‚Äôm a classical pianist who dabbles in jazz and have maintained a 1500-day streak on Duolingo.

## Highlighted Projects
**PDF and YouTube summarizers**: LLM applications using LangChain and RAG. Leveraged Chroma and Weaviate vector databases for efficient text storage and indexing. Compared Faiss, ScaNN, and Annoy similarity-search algorithms. Applied prompt engineering techniques such as in-context learning, few-shot learning and chain-of-thoughts for better reasoning performance.

**French Restaurant Reservation Agent (Chatbot)**: Created a chatbot for initiating and managing restaurant reservations using Rasa. Defined user intents, actions, slots, and responses. Designed conversation flows with ManyChat, and deployed the application using Docker and ngrok. Optimization of the chatbot with Rasa X (CI/CD) and integration with Facebook Messenger. Currently reimplementing the bot on Google Dialogflow CX.

**Deep Learning from Scratch** [[GitHub](https://github.com/CestLucas/Convolutional-Neural-Network)]: Implemented deep learning models and components, including CNN, RNN, GRU, VAE, GAN, Transformer and GPT-2, as well as algorithms such as KL divergence, attention mechanism, and activation functions, using Python 3 and Numpy.

**RPG Game Strategy Optimization** [[GitHub](https://github.com/CestLucas/Approximate-dynamic-programming/)]: Created a text-based RPG game using Python 3. Implemented complex dynamic programming algorithms such as forward recursion, approximate value iteration, and Q-learning to simulate the optimal level-up strategies. Optimized the algorithms using multi-threading.

**JavaScript and Java Web Development**: Imitated Apple‚Äôs dynamic scrolling mechanism with JavaScript Scroll Magic and worked on the Odin Project to create a web service for user login. Created an application for nurse scheduling using the Java backend with Maven, Spring Boot, and MongoDB.

**Brownian Motion Simulation for Quantitative Finance**: Explored the stochastic process and quadratic variation to approximate Brownian motion. Loaded stock data from Yahoo Finance. Implemented Monte Carlo simulations for financial modeling using SciPy and Pandas.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2024-present)**: Donec mattis sed justo et sagittis. Vestibulum lacinia nulla ipsum. Curabitur imperdiet nibh vitae leo lacinia laoreet. Nullam accumsan, lectus ut maximus ultricies, augue justo egestas mi, vel bibendum felis.
